# Lagoon Recomp

A work-in-progress Windows port of Lagoon (USA), using SNESRecomp's generated
native routines alongside its 65816 interpreter safety net. Your own clean ROM
is required. The executable does not depend on Mesen; it is a development reference.

## Current progress - October 20, 2026

Batch30 adds eleven full native services for sprite drawing, tilemap queues and
resource loading. It also corrects instruction timing in the connected sprite
chain and the palette-update helper. **480 AOT / 102 analyzed LLE / 353 roots**
are analysis counts, not completion percentages. All469 previous native entries
remain; unsupported modes, variable scripts and special hardware/display paths
keep the interpreter safety net.

The custom renderer can now draw source-qualified current NPC/enemy/prop poses
without requiring an earlier onscreen pose witness. It uses the actual guest
frame and finite original sprite tables, with no enemy AI or animation prediction.
Four focused actor cases match a genuine original-opcode service control across
7,216 ordered presentations and eight complete state/clock checkpoints. The new
path has806 numeric far-cell observations for four enemy kinds; NPC21 and enemy26
retain source support without a target-positive far-render claim.

Original-opcode tests check162,816 shared-service cases and68,544 credits cases.
A separate368,640-case timing check confirms the former palette timing error.
The assisted ending route now waits for Thor's original NPC-ready flag before
Talk, rather than relying on the old coarse timing. It receives the real pendant,
uses the authored door, fights the final Evil Spirit and reaches THE END.
Small dead-stack/scheduler differences and APU diagnostic timestamps remain
explicit in the original-opcode comparison; these are bounded checks, not a
natural uninterrupted playthrough or a blanket byte-parity claim.

The existing scenery contracts cover all75 authored room descriptors. Titles,
portrait UI and finite world edges retain their original geometry. Every custom
scene replacement is checked against the reference picture, with fallback for
unsupported resources, death forms, multipart actors and special projectiles.

Installed cold ending and actor checks match26,028 pictures and all120 dump files
against the tested candidate;110 protected local inputs remain unchanged.
Use `Start Lagoon.cmd` for the installed build. The owner and friends perform the
uninterrupted campaign and device/controller/audio playtest. See
[batch30 details](docs/NATIVE-BATCH30-2026-10-20.md),
[renderer scope](docs/CUSTOM-RENDERER.md), [current status](docs/DEVELOPMENT-STATUS.md),
[playtest guide](docs/PLAYTEST.md), [widescreen](docs/WIDESCREEN.md) and
[frame pacing](docs/PERFORMANCE.md). Earlier completed work remains in
[batch29](docs/NATIVE-BATCH29-2026-10-20.md).

The existing camera, fast menus, damage/death/revival, boss services, cleave,
Giles first aid, optional QoL, Companion Launcher and Enhanced original pixels
remain enabled through their existing settings and guards. The optional map
with doors/exits and15-20% zoom-out remain deferred.

## Fullscreen screenshots

wide town dialogue, Items/Magic, Atland and Gold Cave.

![Atland dialogue in widescreen fullscreen](docs/screenshots/atland-dialogue-21x9-1920x1080.png)

## Launcher

Use `Start Lagoon.cmd` after building. It opens the shared
[Companion Launcher](https://github.com/rages4calm/companion-launcher), using pinned
0.2.0 packages. The Lagoon adapter verifies your ROM and starts the native game
with its existing config and save locations. The old pre-boot UI is excluded from
the default build; it can be enabled explicitly for development.

Companion exposes executable/ROM/config paths, native display/audio/gamepad
settings, gameplay QoL toggles and experimental widescreen aspects. Apply/Revert
preserves unknown settings and controller bindings and detects stale edits.
Existing native settings remain in `build/config.ini`, input in `build/keybinds.ini`,
and saves in `build/saves`. The adapter does not migrate them.

For a 1,920×1080 monitor, use desktop fullscreen, widescreen 16:9 and optional
Enhanced original pixels. Keep linear filtering and frame blending off for a
sharp picture, with VSync on. Window scale controls only windowed size; leaving
it at 3 is fine in fullscreen. Wider 21:9/32:9 modes reveal more scenery but
make the picture shorter on a 16:9 monitor. The underlying 4:3 display-aspect
setting preserves original pixel proportions while widescreen adds scenery.

## Build from source

Install the Windows toolchain/dependencies documented by
[SNESRecomp](https://github.com/RetroPortingToolKit/snesrecomp): Python 3.10+,
Rust, CMake, Ninja, a supported C/C++ toolchain, SDL3 and zlib. Use a configured
build shell. Generate locally from your own original USA ROM:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
python -P tools/apply_framework_patch.py
bash tools/regen.sh --rom "/path/to/Lagoon (USA).sfc"
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
```

On Windows, use Git's Bash rather than an unconfigured WSL stub. `regen.sh` also
applies/checks the required framework patch. `framework_pins.txt` records the
upstream baseline; `patches/lagoon-framework.patch` carries the local compatibility
and precise-root timing changes. The public submodule pin is reachable upstream.

Build CompanionLauncher 0.2.0's local NuGet packages, then:

```powershell
powershell -File scripts/build_launcher.ps1 -CompanionRoot C:\path\to\CompanionLauncher
```

The game expects SHA256
`46c811f0cacffe8f20e1d63072d25d7c47e9bb3fd5124851fd05aca9884d21fb`,
CRC32 `d2554270`, a 1 MiB unheadered USA LoROM. Patched ROMs are deliberately
rejected by this clean-ROM build. Generated C is ROM-derived and remains local.

## QoL and widescreen

All nine requested QoL changes are implemented and default off. They use guarded
ROM data changes and shared CPU read/write hooks, so generated native routines and
the interpreter see the same gameplay values. Camera centering changes guarded
operands in explicitly interpreted routines, preserving the original scenery
streamer. The supplied BPS informed this
work; it is not bundled or automatically applied. See
[QoL implementation and limits](QOL-IMPLEMENTATION.md) for exact balance values
and the distinction between synthetic tests and gameplay evidence.

Optional widescreen draws additional world backgrounds in supported rooms at
the original pixel scale, with 16:9, 16:10, 21:9, 32:9 and window-driven aspects.
Witnessed ordinary NPC/enemy forms can also appear beyond the game's original
off-screen actor buffer, using resident graphics and read-only presentation
animation. Current scenery support covers audited Atland, Gold Cave and the
outdoor guard exterior (room 2), audited cave rooms 4–6, room 07 parallax and
Elf Field (room 08), clipped to real world bounds. Verified dialogue/Start retain scenery and Items/Magic widen their
frames. Other rooms, title/intro and unadapted panels use native-width fallback.
Special actors, other parallax layouts and campaign coverage remain unfinished. All four fixed aspects preserved guest state and native
center pixels at 18 opening/town checkpoints. See [widescreen details](docs/WIDESCREEN.md).

## Optional enhanced original pixels

Companion's Display page offers **Enhanced original pixels (EPX)**. It rounds
pixel diagonals using the original colors and keeps the bottom HUD sharp.
This follows the original-art treatment used in Secret of the Stars; the full
retexture experiment is shelved. EPX defaults off, requires OpenGL, and restores
your previous graphics settings when disabled. See [the implementation and
bounded GPU checks](docs/ENHANCED-PIXELS.md).

## Optional X68000 soundtrack

The optional soundtrack uses a privately imported VGZ pack, with loop points
preserved. Initial replacement covers opening, Atland and GoldCave; other cues
retain SNES music. SNES audio remains the default. No music is bundled in the
repository. See [setup and current limits](docs/X68000-SOUNDTRACK.md).

## Source and publishing

See [credits](CREDITS.md), including the original
[Lagoon QoL hack](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/9856/) that inspired the
requested comfort changes.

This repository contains source, build configuration and development tools. It
excludes ROMs, generated ROM-derived C, private decompilation exports, extracted
assets, saves, states, screenshots and test captures. No playable release is being
published with this source snapshot. GitHub updates are deliberate batch snapshots,
not an automatic per-feature sync.

Retain the included licenses: the SNESRecomp foundation and its derivatives use
PolyForm Noncommercial; Companion Launcher and the Lagoon launcher adapter use MIT.
Public source availability does not remove the framework's noncommercial terms.
